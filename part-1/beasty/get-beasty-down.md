title: Getting the spider down
order: 10
---

The spider is hanging from the roof.

# How to get it down?
It gets lower time to time. Could you reach it from the armchair (click on the armchair)?

# Still can't reach it
You would need a longer arm.

# Longer arm?
Or extra arm! ^[ There is a skeleton arm left from the door. ]

# I have an arm!
Concentrate on [the cobweb thread](cut-the-thread).
