order: 20

That ugly gargoyle is preventing Spidereye from accessing the radio.

# What to do?
Have you explored all the places the Spidereye can go?

## What place?
Did you note it can climb up the stairway access? ^[ It is the other doorframe. ]

# Oh!
Climb up the stairway access. Climb up more on to the rail. Slide down the rail!
