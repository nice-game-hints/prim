Tristan's donkey, Rainbow, got scared and ran into the bushes.

Could you lure her with some berries?

# What berries?
There are berries around. Collect all _five_ different colored berries.

# She is eating those, but backing up
Maybe there is an exact _order_ in which the berries must be fed to her.

# Any hints on the order?
She is wearing quite cool hat!

## What is the order?
Feed the berries in the order of the stripes in her hat.
