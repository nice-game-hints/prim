The map on the display should make a good replacement map.

# It is locked behind the glass
Did you spot the screws?

# Yes
You might actually already carry something helpful.

Check your inventory. ^[ Look a the purse, you get a metal button ]

Use the button to open the screws.

# The right one is too tight
You need to losen it.

## With what?
Check out the puddle where the donkey used to be. That stuff will remove the rust.

# How do I collect the puddle?
Not with your bare hands. Try to find item to collect liquids into.

## What item?
Pick up the rag hanging on the cart.

Use the rag on the puddle and then on the screw to get it free.
