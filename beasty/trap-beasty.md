title: Trapping the spider
order: 40
---

After you [get the spider beasty down](get-beasty-down.md) it will hide in the bookshelf swapping place between up and bottom gaps.

# How to trap it?
Maybe some kind of round container would catch it.

## Round container?
The bottling jar ^[ On the table. ] is a perfect trap. [Open it](../opening-the-bottling-jar.md), first.

# It is open
Now, trap the spider!

## How?
Put the opened jar in to a gap in the bookshelf and then click on the creature. It will run into the jar.
