order: 20
---

The spider is hangin from the cobweb thread.

# How to cut it?
You have your trusty Swiss Army Scythe with you?

# Can't reach!
Climb on the armchair and try there.

# Still can't reach
You would need a longer arm.

# Longer arm?
Or extra arm! ^[ There is a skeleton arm left from the door. ]

# I have an arm!
You have a longer arm and a tool to cut the thread...

# Tell me
Combine the scythe and the skeleton arm in the inventory. Use the new tool from the armchair on the cobweb thread.

# It escapes!
[You need to distract the spider.](distract-beasty.md)

# Distracted!
Cut the thread with the skeleton arm extended scythe.
