PRIM is a creepy-but-cute point’n’click adventure game full of dark humor. When her mother dies, Prim finds out she’s Death’s daughter and now has to live with her father. But the Grim Reaper has strict rules and when Prim breaks them, things take a fatal turn. Can you breathe life into her misery?

The game has an in-game hint system for most of the puzzles. But especially the first part is missing some.
