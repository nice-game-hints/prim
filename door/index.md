Prim's father locked the door from outside.

# How to open it?
If you could just get to the other side...

# That's what I am trying!
Not Prim necessary. [Did you catch the creature](../beasty/index.md), already?

# I have Spidereye
Great. Maybe it can help you.

# How?
Put it into the crack next to the door.
