The radio is playing smooth jazz. The [ugly gargoyle](ugly_gargoyle.md) is blocking Spidereye.

# Got rid of the gargoyle
Great! Now you can tune the radio. You can change the music style (left knob) and the volume (right knob).

# So, what to do?
Turn the volume down (right knob) to get Thanatos to come and fix the radio.
