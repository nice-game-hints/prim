title: Make Thanatos tired
---

The White Widow will only affect Thanatos if he is already very tired.

# How to tire him?
Given the circumstances, what would be a tiring activity around there?

# What?
Dancing!

# Okay...
Two things need to be in order to get him to dance:
 - The music ^[ Turn the left knob so that the radio plays funky dance music. ]
 - Drugging... ^[ The [Acheron Swamp Trumpet herb](../correct_herb.md) is hell of a party drug. Put some of it [into his pipe](../pipe.md). ]
 
# What moves!
Yeah, and now he is really beat up...
