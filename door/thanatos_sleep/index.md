order: 120
---

To get the keys from Thanatos he would have to be... less alert.

# How?
Do you notice what Thanatos is doing?

# Smoking pipe?
Exactly! Maybe some substance in the pipe would make him sleepy.

# What substance?
You find that stuff from the room. ^[ Take some strange herbs from the bookshelf. ]

# I have the _substance_
Now just put the right stuff. You need to first know [what the two herbs are for](correct_herb.md).

# How to put herbs into the pipe?
[Get access to the pipe.](pipe.md)

# Which herb to put in there?
Well, the White Widow has narcotic effects. But the subject has to [be very tired](thanatos_tired.md).

# He is tired
From dancing? Good. I think he is ready for some White Widow inh his pipe.
