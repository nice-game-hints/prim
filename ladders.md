title: Moving the ladders
order: 55
---

The ladders are stuck. The wheel is too rusty.

# What to do?
Rusty objects are usually loosened with oil.

# Where do I get oil?
Not oil, per se. Maybe something oily?

# What is oily?
The ectoplasm on the floor, in front of the door, is oily enough.

# I have ectoplasm
Use it on the ladder to get it loose.
